# Inventory API (ArangoDB Foxx ÂµService)

CRUD REST API to store generic items hierarchically or container-based on ArangoDB, working as a Foxx microservice.

Stored objects are described as "entities", and can act as containers (parents) or children of other entities. This allows to store stuff like objects in your home (e.g. Bedroom > Wardrobe > Upper-Left Drawer > Box of "Memories" > 4GB DDR3 RAM Stick).

## Data model

```js
{
    "id": "192783", // only on read, corresponds to _id document field (generated by arangodb, cannot be set, unique)
    "name": "Bedroom", // human-readable identifier of the entity (required, not unique)
    "type": "ROOM", // human-readable category/type of the entity (optional)
    "created": 1589711345, // when the entity was created, as unix/epoch timestamp in seconds (autogenerated, cannot be set)
    "updated": 1589711345 // same as created, but when the entity was updated for the last time
    // from here, you can add additional fields with no further validation
    "owner": "Anna"
}
```

## Changelog

- 0.0.1: Initial version with CRUD endpoints, without hierarchy/relationships

## TODO
