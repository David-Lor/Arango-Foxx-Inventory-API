# Inventory API (ArangoDB Foxx ÂµService)

CRUD REST API to store generic items hierarchically or container-based on ArangoDB, working as a Foxx microservice.

Stored objects are described as "entities", and can act as containers (parents) or children of other entities. This allows to store stuff like objects in your home (e.g. Bedroom > Wardrobe > Upper-Left Drawer > Box of "Memories" > 4GB DDR3 RAM Stick).

## Data model

```js
{
    "id": "192783", // only on read, corresponds to _id document field (generated by arangodb, unique)
    "name": "Bedroom", // human-readable identifier of the entity (required, not unique)
    "type": "ROOM", // human-readable category identifier of the entity (optional)
    "extra": { // optional field where you can store extra fields for the entity
        "owner": "Anna"
    }
}
```
